# CMS

It's a simlpe content managment system (CMS) written as a final project at CodersLab - programming school.
Unregitered user can write an article and add comment. After registration it's possible to add new article and 
edit user's data.

All new articles goes to moderation queue. Only user with status "admin" can decide whether this article appears
on the site or not. Articles can be also edited and deletedo by admin. Just like users.
I used Java, Spring, Hibernate, Spring Data to make backend of this site and HTML, JSP, JSTL to make frontend.
I also used IDE IntelliJ Idea, Maven and Tomcat server.

Best way to see this site in action is import repository as a Maven project.
